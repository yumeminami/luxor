## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Completed)

- **Core trait architecture** with `Renderable` and `Measurable` protocols for extensible rendering system
- **Complete color system** supporting Standard 16, 8-bit 256, and TrueColor 24-bit formats with conversion algorithms
- **Style composition system** with inheritance, string parsing (`"bold red on blue"`), and layered style combination
- **Unicode-aware text processing** with proper character width calculation using `unicode-width` crate
- **ANSI escape sequence generation** for cross-platform terminal control and styling
- **Console rendering engine** with terminal capability detection and output stream management
- **Measurement system** for layout constraint solving with min/max width calculations
- **Segment rendering units** as fundamental building blocks for styled text output
- **Comprehensive error handling** using `thiserror` crate with structured error types

#### Phase 2: Text & Markup System (Completed - Core Components)

- **Rich markup parser** implementing BBCode-style syntax (`[bold red]text[/bold red]`, `[italic]text[/italic]`)
  - Nested tag support with proper style composition
  - Error handling for malformed markup with detailed error messages
  - Integration with existing Style and Color systems
- **Enhanced Text struct** with style span support for applying styles to character ranges
- **Span system** for efficient management of style ranges within text content
- **Text methods** including `stylize_range()`, `from_markup()`, and `with_style()` for flexible text styling
- **Comprehensive integration** with Console rendering pipeline and existing trait system

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture

- **Two-phase rendering pipeline**: Measurement phase followed by rendering phase for optimal layout
- **Trait object support**: `Box<dyn Renderable>` for heterogeneous collections of renderable components
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Efficient string handling and minimal allocations in hot paths
- **Memory safety**: No unsafe code, proper Rust ownership model throughout

#### Dependencies

- `crossterm` (0.27) - Cross-platform terminal manipulation and control
- `unicode-width` (0.1) - Unicode character width calculation for proper text layout
- `thiserror` (1.0) - Structured error handling with detailed error messages

#### Testing & Quality

- **138 tests passing** across all test suites:
  - 62 unit tests covering individual module functionality
  - 12 integration tests for end-to-end workflows
  - 14 property-based tests using `proptest` for invariant validation
  - 50 documentation tests ensuring example code works correctly
- **Zero clippy warnings** with strict quality enforcement (`-D warnings`)
- **Comprehensive benchmarks** for performance monitoring and optimization
- **100% code formatting** compliance using `rustfmt`

#### Performance Features

- **Efficient text processing** with Unicode-aware algorithms
- **Minimal memory allocations** in rendering hot paths
- **String optimization** preferring `&str` over `String` where possible
- **SIMD-ready architecture** for future text processing optimizations

### Work in Progress

#### Phase 2: Text & Markup System (Remaining)

- Text word wrapping with Unicode awareness and intelligent line breaking
- Text alignment system (left, center, right, justify) with overflow handling
- Highlighter framework for regex-based text highlighting and syntax support

### Planned Features

#### Phase 3: Layout Foundation (Next Priority)

- `Layout` class for flexible horizontal/vertical splits with constraint solving
- `Padding` system for space management around content with various padding modes
- `Align` component for content alignment within containers
- `Constrain` system for size constraints and content overflow handling
- `Region` management for rectangular screen areas with intersection/clipping

#### Phase 4: Core UI Components

- `Panel` - Bordered containers with rich markup titles and subtitles
- `Table` - Feature-rich tables with auto-sizing, sorting, and styling
- `Rule` - Horizontal/vertical separators and lines with styling options
- `Bar` - Progress bars and data visualization with gradient support

#### Future Phases (5-8)

- Advanced components (Tree, Columns, Progress, Live updates)
- Content rendering (Markdown, Syntax highlighting, Pretty printing)
- Interactive features (Prompts, Screen management, Dynamic content)
- Integration & Export (HTML/SVG export, Themes, Platform compatibility)

### Breaking Changes

- None yet (pre-1.0 development)

### Documentation

- Comprehensive API documentation with examples for all public interfaces
- Updated project roadmap with 8-phase development plan
- Analysis of Python Rich library showing 54 modules vs originally planned subset
- Performance goals targeting 10-100x improvement over Python Rich
- Development guidelines and coding standards documentation

### Notes

- This release represents the foundational architecture for a complete Rust implementation of Python Rich
- Current implementation covers approximately 30% of Rich's complete feature set
- Focus on Rich-like user experience combined with Rust-idiomatic patterns and performance
- Full feature parity estimated at 26-35 weeks of development time
